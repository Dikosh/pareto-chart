# pareto-chart
The  Pareto  Chart  brings  immediate  focus  to  which reasons are part of the “vital few”  and  thus  should  receive  attention  first.  By  dropping  a  vertical  line  from  where  the  horizontal  line  a t  80%  intersects  the  cumulative  percentage  line,  t his  chart  shows  that  traffic,  oversleeping,  and  alarm  failure  are  the  most  critical  reasons  that  people  in  our  survey  are  late  for  work.  The  next  step  in  our  problem  solving  activity might  be  to  use  the  5  W hys  or  Ishikawa/Fishbone  Diagram  techniques  to  determine  the  root  causes  of  those reasons.
